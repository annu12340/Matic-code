# Matic-code

### My personal workflow

1. Write the ordinary smart contract (without matic)
2. Create an account in metamask with matic and add 2 eth to it :
   https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/remix#compile-smart-contract

3) Replace the code in truffle-config.js with https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/truffle
4) Run the following cmds

```
 truffle compile
 truffle migrate --network matic
 npm run dev
```
